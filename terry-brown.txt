Stretch Questions

    1. What is the difference between an inline element and a block element? - Block elements create their own block on the page, occupying that space. so after a block element, there will be a new line,inline elements can group side by side, and will not create a new line afterwards.
    2. What happens when an element is positioned absolutely? - absolute positions removes the element from the document flow. if it has a parent, it will position itself based on that, if not, it will position itself on the body of the document. and will stay at that position.
    3. How do I make an element take up only the amount of space it needs but also have the ability to give it a width? - display:flex achieves this. and allows you to adjust spacing as well.
    4. Name 3 elements that are display block by default, 2 elements that are display inline by default and 1 element that is display inline-block by default - display:block( div, nav, section ), display:inline( a, span, img ), display:inline-block( button )
    5. In your own words, explain the box model. What is the "fix" for the box model, in other words, how do we make all elements respect the width we've given them? - the box model is basically a box that wraps around all html elements that you can adjust with borders, margins, padding, and the content inside the box. unfortunately it adds all of these on top of your width, so if you define width:100px; and have a 10px padding-left, then your total width is now 110px, this is fixed by using box-sizing:border-box, which is a nice solution that will include your padding, borders, margins etc into the total width.
